## WHAT IS MINI-MOTE?				#WIM

Mini-Mote is an application for the TDA that serves as a simplistic 
universal remote controller. Several different devices will be able 
to connect and automatically update the remote so that users don't 
need to hassle with multiple remotes and their instructions. By 
having a built in product code, the device can easily adapt to any 
living space.

touch screen is on the left side and the right side of the screen 
shows the physical side of the device. In order to turn on or off 
the Mini-Mote, please press the top most physical button on the 
right side of the device.

## GOING BACK TO THE MAIN MENU			#MMU
